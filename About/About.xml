	<description>Outfit management
    
    Set the desired weights for buffs and penalties for each outfit type, and watch your Pawns choose their gear automatically - no more micromanagement.
	In addition to the classic allow/disallow selection, you can now define which parameters a Pawn should prioritize.
	
	Is it battle time, where sharp or blunt protection is the priority?
	Should a miner focus on mining yield or speed?
	Or is it a hauler, where carry capacity and movement speed matter most?
		
	Makes a perfect combo with Combat Extended, Better Pawn Control, and Gear Up And Go.
