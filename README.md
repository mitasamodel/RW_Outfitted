Outfit management

## Features
Set the desired weights for buffs and penalties for each outfit type, and watch your Pawns choose their gear automatically - no more micromanagement.
In addition to the classic allow/disallow selection, you can now define which parameters a Pawn should prioritize.

Is it battle time, where sharp or blunt protection is the priority?
Should a miner focus on mining yield or speed?
Or is it a hauler, where carry capacity and movement speed matter most?
	
Makes a perfect combo with Combat Extended, Better Pawn Control, and Gear Up And Go.

## F.A.Q.
### Can I install this on existing colonies?
Yes, you can use Outfitted with your ongoing game. It'll import your outfits to the new format.
### Can I use this with (random mod)?
Yes! Everything works with any mod that adds Stats like Infused.
